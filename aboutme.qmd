Hello everyone! My name is Connor Ross and this is my first year at UGA
as a MPH student in the epidemiology concentration. I went to the
University of South Carolina for my bachelors degree in public health
and completed a year of masters work before my partner was deployed. At
which time, I worked for the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control in the Division of Acute Disease Epidemiology
(where I still work part-time) and for the University of South Carolina
Infectious Disease Lab primarily working with COVID-19, vector-borne,
and neglected tropical diseases. After my partner returned we moved to
his next assignment at Fort Gordon near Augusta and I began the MPH
program here. At USC, I was given a very brief introduction to R but we
primarily used SAS and some STATA for analysis, however, last semester,
I received more R training in the EPID 7500 course. I would like to
receive a better understanding of coding and best practices from this
course, as my previous training were mainly focus on data analysis and
interpretation. Outside of work and academia, I enjoy hiking, camping,
kayaking, and reading.

## Here's what I look like...

Please feel free to reach out! I'm new here and excited to meet new
people.

## Interested in research?

This is a article I co-authored on one of the projects I was involved in
at USC:

[**Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccination among a State-Wide Year-Long
Surveillance Initiative in a Conservative Southern
State**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/3/412?fbclid=IwAR0sOxb6EvRHxqv8IDZk0aeb2fee1pyCRFWHu7Ee6Bv_MDuJIpZ0uygSAXk)

It's on a year COVID-19 prevalence and vaccination surveillance study in
South Carolina. There were several analysis conducted for this paper
including a principal component analysis, survival analysis, and a
geospatial temporal analysis. This project is unique in that it provided
us funding for primary data collection, and testing using new technology
call d-PCR (compared to q-PCR) and even a continuation of this project
now called [All-IN SC](https://allin-sc.org/).

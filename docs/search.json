    "text": "Hello everyone! My name is Connor Ross and this is my first year at UGA as a MPH student in the epidemiology concentration. I went to the University of South Carolina for my bachelors degree in public health and completed a year of masters work before my partner was deployed. At which time, I worked for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in the Division of Acute Disease Epidemiology (where I still work part-time) and for the University of South Carolina Infectious Disease Lab primarily working with COVID-19, vector-borne, and neglected tropical diseases. After my partner returned we moved to his next assignment at Fort Gordon near Augusta and I began the MPH program here. At USC, I was given a very brief introduction to R but we primarily used SAS and some STATA for analysis, however, last semester, I received more R training in the EPID 7500 course. I would like to receive a better understanding of coding and best practices from this course, as my previous training were mainly focus on data analysis and interpretation. Outside of work and academia, I enjoy hiking, camping, kayaking, and reading."

There were several analysis conducted for this paper including a principal component analysis, survival analysis, and a geospatial temporal analysis. This project is unique in that it provided us funding for primary data collection, and testing using new technology call d-PCR (compared to q-PCR) and even a continuation of this project now called All-IN SC."
